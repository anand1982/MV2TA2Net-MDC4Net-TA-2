## Dataset Description
![CCMT Dataset Sample Images](L-D.png)
The dataset used in this study contains leaf images from four crop species:

* cassava
* cashew
* maize
* tomato

Each crop contains multiple healthy and diseased classes.

## Overview

The CCMT dataset is a multi-crop plant disease image dataset developed for crop disease classification and deep learning-based agricultural research. It contains leaf images collected from four major crop species: cassava, cashew, maize, and tomato. The dataset is designed to support multi-class and multi-crop disease recognition tasks and is widely used for evaluating transfer learning models, lightweight convolutional neural networks, hybrid deep learning frameworks, and attention-based classification methods.

The dataset includes both healthy and diseased leaf categories, allowing models to learn disease discrimination across visually similar classes and diverse crop species.

## Crop-wise Disease Classes

### 1. Cassava
![Cassava Disease and Healthy Sample Images](C1.png)

Cassava classes included in the dataset represent major foliar diseases commonly affecting cassava production.

#### Disease Classes

* Cassava Bacterial Blight (CBB)
* Cassava Brown Streak Disease (CBSD)
* Cassava Green Mottle (CGM)
* Cassava Mosaic Disease (CMD)
* Healthy Cassava

#### Disease Characteristics

* Cassava Bacterial Blight shows angular brown lesions and tissue necrosis.
* Cassava Brown Streak Disease presents chlorotic yellow vein-associated patterns.
* Cassava Green Mottle exhibits irregular green-yellow mottling.
* Cassava Mosaic Disease shows mosaic chlorosis and leaf deformation.

### 2. Cashew

Cashew classes represent major fungal and pest-related diseases affecting leaf health.

#### Disease Classes

* Anthracnose
* Gummosis
* Leaf Miner
* Red Rust
* Healthy Cashew

#### Disease Characteristics

* Anthracnose causes dark necrotic lesions with irregular boundaries.
* Gummosis affects tissue integrity and leaf health.
* Leaf Miner creates visible internal feeding tunnels.
* Red Rust appears as orange-red fungal patches on the leaf surface.

Maize classes include important foliar diseases that affect cereal crop productivity.

#### Disease Classes

* Fall Armyworm
* Grasshoper
* Leaf Spot
* Leaf Blight
* Healthy Maize
* Leaf Beetle
* Streak Virus

#### Disease Characteristics

* Common Rust produces reddish-brown pustules.
* Gray Leaf Spot forms elongated rectangular lesions.
* Northern Leaf Blight creates long cigar-shaped necrotic lesions.

### 4. Tomato

Tomato contributes the largest number of disease classes in the dataset.

#### Disease Classes

* Late Blight
* Septoria Leaf Spot
* Verticulium Wilt
* Leaf Curl 
* Healthy Tomato

#### Disease Characteristics

* Late Blight causes water-soaked irregular lesions.
* Verticillium Wilt is a fungal disease that causes leaf yellowing, wilting, and drying by blocking water.
* Septoria Leaf Spot creates small circular necrotic spots.
* Yellow Leaf Curl Virus causes upward curling and yellowing.
